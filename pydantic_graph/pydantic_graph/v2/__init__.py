"""The next version of the pydantic-graph framework with enhanced graph execution capabilities.

This module provides a parallel control flow graph execution framework with support for:
- 'Step' nodes for task execution
- 'Decision' nodes for conditional branching
- 'Fork' nodes for parallel execution coordination
- 'Join' nodes and 'Reducer's for re-joining parallel executions
- Mermaid diagram generation for graph visualization
