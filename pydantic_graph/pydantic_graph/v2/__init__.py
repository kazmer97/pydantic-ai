"""Version 2 of the pydantic-graph framework with enhanced graph execution capabilities.

This module provides an advanced graph execution framework with support for:
- Decision nodes for conditional branching
- Join nodes for parallel execution coordination
- Step nodes for sequential task execution
- Comprehensive path tracking and visualization
- Mermaid diagram generation for graph visualization
