- GraphWalker has to be serializable
	- Deps have to be serializable
		- This can be done by making it a dataclass that has a way to get all the non-serializable bits from the serializable bits
	- GraphRunAPI has to be serializable
		- This can be done by just giving it the ID and a way to get a connection to the state DB
	- Graph has to be serializable
		- Need a way to drop the need for state_type, deps_type etc. to be stored on the graph itself
		- Need a way to serialize steps/transforms/etc. (which generally have  calls)
			- Maybe possible by converting a function call into a dataclass under the hood..?
			- Better: Node registry, similar to how we do evaluators
				- Make Path serializable by:
					- Having destination be a nodeid not a node
				- Replace branch.source with _just_ matches, in a way that is serializable (IsInstanceOf or whatever)
				- Matches types (callable dataclasses) for checking decision matches
				- Transform types (callable dataclasses)
				- Join Reducer types need to be serializable/deserializable
				- Steps should be serializable/deserializable (ideally possible to serialize/deserialize as function references)
					- Can potentially make it work by providing a dictionary of functions for serializing/deserializing. Note this would disallow lambdas/etc., but that's probably fine.


- Graph can be an argument
